# CountDownTimer


This HTML code creates a simple web page to display a countdown timer for New Year's Eve celebration. The page structure includes metadata, the page title, links to style sheets and JavaScript scripts, and a body with a heading ("New Year Eve") and a container to show the timer. The elements inside the container represent the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the event and are dynamically updated using a script.
